    * David Rodriguez is a junior at Brooklyn College studying computer science with a minor in data science, 
    he spends his time working on projects and participating in his college community. 


## Purpose
The project aims to use machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze food images and identify them. By using diverse datasets, the model will learn to recognize dishes based on visual features. Our project aims to inform'
users about what it is they are eating, including potential nutritional value and an AI generated response on how there 
dish might have been prepared.


## Key Features
* Image classification
* AI generated nutritional information
* AI generated 
recipe used for the dish
